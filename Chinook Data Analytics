-- In this SQL project I am querying a database called Chinook, which represents a digital media store to answer certain questions related to the dataset.

#1. List Customers (full names, customer ID and country) who are only in the US.

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers WHERE Country = 'USA';

#2. List the information (full names, customer ID and country) for all Customers that are not in Canada.

SELECT CustomerId, Firstname, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers WHERE Country <> 'Canada';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from USA. The resulting table should show the
customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice and billing country.

SELECT C.Firstname, C.LastName, I.InvoiceId, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers C LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId WHERE C.Country = 'USA';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Support Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title FROM chinook.employees WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table, ordered by country.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices ORDER BY BillingCountry;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name and email.

SELECT E.LastName, E.FirstName, E.email, I.InvoiceId FROM chinook.employees E
JOIN chinook.customers C ON C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices I ON I.CustomerId = C.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT I.Total, C.FirstName, C.LastName, C.Country, E.FirstName, E.LastName FROM chinook.customers C
JOIN chinook.invoices I ON I.CustomerId = C.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees E ON E.EmployeeId = C.SupportRepId;

#8. How many invoices were there on the year 2010?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31'

#9. Show a list of the artists and their albums, sorted by artist.

SELECT Art.Name, Alb.Title FROM chinook.artists Art
JOIN chinook.albums Alb ON Art.ArtistId = Alb.ArtistId ORDER BY Art.Name

#10. Show all the track names along with their genre, album and unit price.

SELECT T.Name AS track, Alb.Title AS Album, G.Name AS genre, T.UnitPrice FROM chinook.albums Alb
JOIN chinook.tracks T ON T.AlbumId = Alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.genres G ON G.GenreId = T.GenreId;

#11. Show the total sales made by each sales support agent.

SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, ROUND(SUM(I.Total)) AS total_sales FROM chinook.employees E
JOIN chinook.customers C ON C.SupportRepId = E.EmployeeId 
JOIN chinook.invoices I ON I.CustomerId = C.CustomerId WHERE E.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' GROUP BY E.FirstName;

#12. Show the total sales made in 2010.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS total_sales FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

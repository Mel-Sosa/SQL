LEFT JOIN Formula1_DB.results R ON D.driverId = R.driverId
WHERE R.raceId = 6 ORDER BY R.position

#4. Who is the driver with the fastest lap time?
SELECT D.surname, D.forename, R.fastestLapTime FROM Formula1_DB.drivers D
JOIN Formula1_DB.results R ON D.driverId = R.driverId
WHERE R.fastestLapTime <>'' ORDER BY R.fastestLapTime asc LIMIT 1

#5. What is the average lap speed by driver? (List the driver name and the average lap speed)
SELECT D.surname, AVG(fastestLapSpeed) AS Avg_Lapspeed FROM Formula1_DB.drivers D
JOIN Formula1_DB.results R ON D.driverId = R.driverId

#6. What is the average points by driver that positioned in 1st place? List the drivers ordered by most avg points to least. 
SELECT D.surname, AVG(points) FROM Formula1_DB.drivers D

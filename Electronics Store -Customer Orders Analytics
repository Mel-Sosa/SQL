SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6 AND orderID <>'' ;

SELECT COUNT(Product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE order_id <> 'Order ID' AND length (order_id) =6;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

WHERE Product <>'' AND price <> 'Price Each' GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue

GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(FebSales.Quantity*price) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2 AND length (orderid) =6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
